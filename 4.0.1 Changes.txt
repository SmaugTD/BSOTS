4.0.1:

Fixed
	missing Disruptor Torpedo icon
	missing Advanced Drone model for all races

Removed fusion requirement for fission-era dual weapon techs:
	Disruptor cannon
	Gauss cannon
	Mass driver
	Shotgun PD
	UV lasers (pulsed & beam)
	Neutron Beams

Strafe sections & drones no longer allow:
	dual weapons
	autocannons
	stormers
	dumbfires

Ballistics weapons
	Most ballistic weapon techs no longer require fusion tech
	The triple barreled weapon is once again a large mount special for the ballistics heavy races
		reasoning: energy heavy races have TONs of options - but ballistics just don't (and this is just more fun!)

Drones
	Updated the minelayer drone to use the Assault Shuttle model (no guns, just bombs, on these puppies)

4.0:

Disruptors
	Disruptor Whip is now free (Zuul only)
	Added dual disruptor cannons to tech tree
	Removed "Heavy Disruptor" -- since there is already a Heavy Disruptor Cannon
	Rearranged tech tree for these elements
	All disruptor techs are now fission age
	
Dreadnoughts
	Rearranged weapons - mainly restored medium & small mounts, but left all huge mounts alone
	
Drones
	NO LONGER using any of ACM's gunship, gunboat, and drone models - they were too buggy

Emitters
	Advanced Emitters now has a tech box!
	Emitter projectors are now free with fusion + cruisers + large emitters (reused its tech box for advanced emitters - something had to give)

Tracking Torpedos
	Require Predictive Targeting
	
Mines
	Added link to nuclear mines from fusion warheads (allows you another shot to get onto the mine tech-tree)

Sheild Bursters
	Removed from game - they were too buggy

Smart Nanites
	Removed link from elemental nanites (now they're enabled from any nanite weapon tech, including nanite virus)
	
Tech Costs
	Reduced the number of techs that are free
	Scaled the upper techs more evenly across the spectrum - increasing much of the early AM era tech costs by about 50%
		Rationale: My games have been well paced up until AM, where everything suddenly becomes cheap and there's little tech to research after AM
		My hope is that this will push back AM, and will make acquiring AM techs more of a wish-items in late game, instead of a quick stop in Fusion
		before shooting on to AM shortly thereafter.
	Scaled a few of the earlier techs to require 25% more research time as well (polarized plasma, light emitter, direct fire missiles, ... and a nmber of other early strong weapons)
	
Tech Chances
	Reduced the number of techs that are guaranteed - restoring the whims of the fates
