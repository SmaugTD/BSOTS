      Weapons
======================

Ballistic Weaons' Mass (AP = .5x):

NAME		   BSOTS	SOTS
Shotgun PD		   1	   -
PD				   5	  40
Small			  50	 100
Medium			 100	 250
Heavy			 300	 900
Rail Cannon		1000	1000
Stormers	       5	   8
Heavy Stormers	  20	  25
Huge Stormers	  50	   -
Sm Autocannon	   1	   -
Md Autocannon	   5	   -
Hv Autocannon     20	   -
Kinetic Msl		2000	5000

Note: knock-back is also based on the speed of the projectile, not merely the mass
      BSOTS increases most weapons speed as well, thus increasing the overall knock-back 
	  (so it is less than in SOTS, but not as drastically less if you only consider the mass)

Fast Missiles = 2x speed of standard missiles, and 1+1/3 faster ROF (i.e. .75 cycle time) => 1+1/3 DPS (and able to hunt down faster targets)
Dual Weapons (other than missiles) are 1+1/3 slower ROF, making them have 1.5x DPS potential = 2/1.333 => 1.5
		
TURRET Classes:

	_class_					_allows_					_displays_				_notes_
	Standard				A: standard, missile		standard turret
	Strafe					A: standard, missile		-
	Spinal					A: spnial					-
	Projector				A: projector				projector turret
	Missile					A: missile					missile turret			w/ default 45' max Y & slow tracking
	Planetmissile			A: planetmissile, missile	ICBM dual turret		used to be for ICBM (huge missiles) - are we not already handling that viz large missile + explicit turrets (or projector + explicit turrets)
	Beam					A: heavybeam 				-						beam turretclass really means heavybeam weapons (HCL, etc.), and beam weapons means standard turretclass
	Freebeam				A: freebeam					freebeam turret			zuul only, heavybeam weapons (HCL, etc.)
	Grapple					A: grapple					standard turret
	Torpedo					A: torpedo					-
	Nodemissilerider		A: nodemissilerider			-						commandeered for use by drones as "mini torps"
