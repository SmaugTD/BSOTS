BSOTS 2.0

Turrets / Barrels
*gatling come from ACM chainbl / chainbl2 which were medium & large, respectively


Cost Rules (of thumb - the tech trees aren't organized consistently, so the prices cannot be consistent either, not across trees)

Dual Small = 2x cost of base weapon
Dual Medium = 2.5x
Dual Large = 3x
Upgrade dual to same size = new cost - old cost
Polarized = 1.5x
Heavy Cannon = 1.5x
Projector = 2x


Weapon costs:
heavy = 5x
dual = 3x
specialization = 1x


AP & Polarized Plasma:
ricochet = -1.5, -2.0, -2.5

--------------	

Got rid of platform missiles: _AsteroidMonitor, DNDefencePlatform, DNTorpedoPlatform
>>> Now they're projector mounts, and we have projector heavy missile variants

--------------	

Make projector based weapons (free) with base tech:
- double heavy missiles (allow w/o heavy missiles?)
- triple heavy drivers
- triple heavy lasers
- triple heavy beamers
- dual torpedo turrets
- triple large-beams

-OR-

Make variants for the Projector-requiring sections which just have a heavy in those slots (at least for Asteroid Monitor)
