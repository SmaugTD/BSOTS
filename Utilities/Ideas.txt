Advanced Robotics - move to industrial tree, so that drones are off of cybernetics root - so that they can be researched early & often. :)

New Ideas:

	Make Smart Nanites available off of Elemental Nanites, but requires any of the militarized nanite techs (missile, mine, bio-war)
	Have a lesser torpedo (barrage) section in fusion age, and the full crazy one in AM age...
	Have a lesser assault (beamer) section in fusion age, then the full crazy one in AM age...

	Increase Maint cost of CRs by 2x.
	
	give repair points to constructors
	Have a full line of heavy and light constructors with fission & fusion engines
	
	Add techs for Barrage and Assault (combat?) - do not just give them because you got the weapons (you get blazer and torpedo automatically with the weapons)
	^^^ Just bridge sections?  Barrage and Assault bridges must be bought?...

Add projector weapons:
	Large Beams
	Fixed Beams
	Laser (UV+)
	Beamer (UV+)
	
Weapons:
	Shield-Disruptor beam (large mount)
	
Great models from ACM/Combined:

	_enforcer DE police?
	_hunter & _interceptor (also various l/m/h gunship- models) - "hunter" and "gunshp"
	sdp.x (siege defense platform) - liir looks amazing!
	ACM's Zuul gunbots waaaay better than stock
	Zuul - ACM - cr-raider.x - gunbot carrier... nice
	hbeamsat.x - heavy beam sat

Mini-torpedos for drones...?
	Make complete use of planetmissile turrets for drones, with specialized weapons for them?

DONE:	
	Increase CR scout range.
	Move all constructors to DE class ships.
	Differentiate CNC by HP (squad/strike/armada)
	move all phasers to antimatter
	fix heavy plasma cannons: orange!
	fix sound for all plasma - NOT SIZZLING!  What then?
