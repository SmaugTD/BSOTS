Session.log errors & warnings you can safely ignore:
	1. At the start of any game, you may see the following if you look.  They are irrelevant and harmless - they occur because I renamed various ship sections to force the game NOT to create stupid default ship designs at the start of every game:
		Warning: [Species/Zuul/sections/DEArmor.shipsection] Can't find ship section in dictionary.
		Warning: [Species/Zuul/sections/DETanker.shipsection] Can't find ship section in dictionary.
		Warning: [Species/Zuul/sections/DEColonizer.shipsection] Can't find ship section in dictionary.
		Warning: [Species/Zuul/sections/DEExtendedRange.shipsection] Can't find ship section in dictionary.
		Warning: [Species/Zuul/sections/DEDefencePlatform.shipsection] Can't find ship section in dictionary.
		Warning: [Species/Liir/sections/DEAntimatter.shipsection] Can't find ship section in dictionary.
		Warning: [Species/Liir/sections/CRAntimatter.shipsection] Can't find ship section in dictionary.
		Warning: [Species/Liir/sections/DNAntimatter.shipsection] Can't find ship section in dictionary.
	NOTE: the above will repeat for each player...
	
	2. You may possibly see these as well, depending on who you play as:
		Warning: [Species/Tarkas/sections/CRTerrorize.shipsection] Can't find ship section in dictionary.
	   These do not matter.

	3.These warnings are from vanilla SOTS and are meaningless:
		Warning: GameSetup: No starmap shape selected, using default.
		Warning: [GUI/MainMenu/Title.tga] Texture load failed.
		Warning: [GUI/MainMenu/NebulaA.tga] Texture load failed.
		Warning: [GUI/MainMenu/NebulaB.tga] Texture load failed.

		Warning: [Models/Planets/Human_PoorPop_Low.dds] Texture load failed.
		Warning: [Models/Planets/Human_Atmosphere_Poor.dds] Texture load failed.

	4. These warnings are due to renaming all of the weapon files, and are harmless:
		Warning: Weapon not found: "Weapons/trp_plasma.weapon" - Was it added to the index file?
		Warning: Weapon not found: "Weapons/las_pd.weapon" - Was it added to the index file?
