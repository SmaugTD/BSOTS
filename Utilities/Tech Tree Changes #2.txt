BSOTS 2.1

Tech Tree Changes:

Moved cloaking from Shields to Sensors tree (aka communications & trade)
deleted Fusn -> Clk
added sensor jammers -> clk
added ftlcom -> Clk

Reorganized Power Tech in fusion era
moved micro fusion drives to Warhead tree
moved small fusion drives to Drone tree
deleted fusn -> small fusion
deleted long range fusion -> ramscoops
added fusn -> ramscoops
deleted ionic -> everything else

Reorganized Energy Tree around Disruptors & Swapped Beams/Emitters
disruptor cannon are disconnected from disruptor torpedos
deleted plasma cannon -> plasma torpedo
linked disruptors to intcan
swapped beams and emitters (will facilitate future links between beamers and beams)

Reorganized Industrial Tech
added new DEDrone (linked from DEConstr)
added new CRDrone (linked from Cruiser Construction)
added new DNDrone (linked from Dreadnought Construction)
moved point defense here (linked from DEConstr) -> Renamed to "DEPtDfs"
added CRPointDefense cruiser point defense (linked from cruiscons)
reorganized hardened structures & tractor beams & etc. (top of industrial tree)

Reorganized Cybernetics (Automation/Drone)
moved small fusion here from power tech (linked from advanced drone frames)
reorganized advanced robotics and moved most of the COL techs to branch from there
moved predictive gunnery to hang off of expert systems
reordered resonant algorithsm & other CNC techs to be "CnC" -> "Bonus CnC" -> "Improved CnC" -> "Bonus CnC" -> "Advanced CnC" -> "Flag CnC"

Reorganized / Expanded Warhead tree
added DualDFMsl
added HvyDFMsl
added DualHvyDFMsl
moved micro fusion drives here (linked from fusion warhead)
reorganized nanite missiles, and various parts of this tree
