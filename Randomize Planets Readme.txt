Simply run "Randomize Planets.bat" 

It will configure Bastard Sword of the Stars to one of twelve possible dead/barren world scripts to keep the visuals interesting.
This has no effect on your save games, so is safe to do anytime SOTS is NOT RUNNING (between sessions).

This is R2dical's work, I only adapted it for BSOTS 2.0 to make it easier to enjoy!
