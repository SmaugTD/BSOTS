2.5:
^ Fixed: 
	Morrigi CR Barrage firing arcs
	Morrigi Freighter, Mega-Freighter weapon icon placements
	DE Minelayer Sat icon placements (all races)
	Corrosive and Nanite mines now work properly (messy, like their missile counterparts, but they do work)
	Human Spinal Mount shoots from the correct node (visuals are improved)
	Flagship command requires huge construction
	Many weapon icon placements fixed & made more flexible (more options)
	Many ships firing arcs improved

^ Updated:
	Tech Tree snapshot image (should be 100% accurate)
	
^ Added:
	Fusion age start variant tech file
	BTM script for choosing tech file
	Many new triple barrel huge mount weapon variants
	Mini-Torpedo weapons for bomber drones
	
^ Technology:
	Dual mounts are all core techs now
	Reduced tech costs and scaled them with a better curve
	Sclaed tech costs of early technology to make early game flow better
	Warheads start with conventional explosive, and then move to nukes
	Nuclear Mines requires Nuclear Warheads (not the starting conventional warheads)
	Autocannons require the underlying level of ballistics size tech (so light requires gauss, ACs require mass drivers, etc.)
	Many weapon techs follow the principle that if you get the base technology, you'll get several more before another roll is made to see if you get the most advanced varieties
		Means either you have a base tech or not, but you'll be able to flesh it out and improve it significantly before your scientists can't proceed (if they roll badly)
	Advanced Sensors now require Fusion (same as advanced cloaking)
	Small Fusion Drives now requires something that can benefit from it - bio-misiles, assault shuttles, drones
	Deconstruction is now free (Ai and players were having a hard time finding repair - which is behind that)
	Disabled commerce raiding (Ai wastes a ton of ships on pointless raiding that doesn't work worth a damn)
	
^ Weapons:
	Reduced population damage by about half from ship based weapons (with a few obvious exceptions, such as the siege driver, which was dramatically increased)
	Increased infrastructure damage by 3x
	Reduced climate damage by about 1/2
	Rebalanced the Siege Drive (imagine throwing an extinction level event asteroid at a world - with every shot) 
	Mines self-destruct as they used to (2 min timer) due to battlefield becoming utterly overwhelmed with them
	Turret tracking is greatly reduced (so that this actually has some effect on whether weapons can fire or not)
	PD weapons are no better than 1x turret speed (beam PD is .5 turret speed)
	Enhanced Pulsed Laser visuals (and X-Ray in particular)
	Photon torpedos
		get 1,2,4 shots for type I, II, III
		have some armor penetration for type II and type III
	Disruptor line is a bit less damaging, but has stronger EMP effects
	Revamped the autocannon line 
		made the costs much more reasonable
		as long ranged as standard ballistics
		as poor accuracy as standard ballistics
		have less ricochet as standard ballistics
		scaled the ROF to be fastest for the light AC, and get slower with size, which gives a better asthetic visually (and doesn't crush your frame rates as badly)
		improved the sound effects
	Enhanced shotgun PD (but ballistic PD is just... not any good at shooting down small targets!)
	Added triple barrel huge weapons for huge (aka projector) mounts
		triple ballistic cannons is now a huge mount
		triple energy cannons (comes with with dual energy cannons)
		triple beam weapons (comes with dual beam weapons such as positron beam, etc.)
	Added dedicated mini-torpedos
		generally shoot 2x as often, but do 1/3 the damage (hence 2/3 as powerful as a standard torp)
		only allowed to be mounted on bomber drones
	Improved Shotgun PD
	Enhanced visuals for fast missiles
	
^ Ships:
	Ships are -20% health
	Liir are -20% health more than everyone else, making them truly the glass cannons that they're supossed to be
	Stations now require maintainance (see maintainance, below)
	DE -> [S]
	CR -> [L]
	DN -> [H]
	DNWar -> Broadside
	Ai option for a bridge section increases the section's cost by 2x
	Ships can have deflective and reflective enhancements simultaneously
	Shileds are more extreme (fast shields are really fast, but really low stopping power vs. heavy shields are slow, but quite high stopping power)
	Scanner Satts no longer allow Quantum Chaff or Jammer options
	DeepScan bridge no longer allow Quantum Chaff or Jammer options
	Deep Scan mission no longer allows Jammer or Quantum Chaff as options (made no sense on DE)

^ Drones
	Bomber Drones now have dedicated mini-torpedo mounts and weapons
		So what you can place on a bomber drone makes much more sense now
		They're shorter ranged than their full ship based counterparts
		Seeking mini-torps move faster but explode much sooner
	All mounts changed to strafe
		Hence missiles are never allowed (except for bomber drones)
	Firing arcs for drones has been massively narrowed (they should never have been able to fire sideways out of their fixed mounts)
		This may help SOTS point the drones at their targets when shooting!
	
^ Encounters:
	The galaxy is a bit rougher in general

^ Maintanance:
	Greatly incrased maintainance costs to better balance the economy:
	ship class			bsots cost	vanilla cost

	[S] satellite		$250		$100
	[L] satellite		$750		$500
	[H] satellite		$1,500		$1,000

^ Thanks:
	To Puglebuble's Ngen mod for some of these ideas (especially reduced turret tracking)
	
Want:
- Redo the autocannon line to spawn off of main mass driver line (i.e. medium requires medium mass driver, etc.)
	- Allow autocannon duals based on ballistic duals
	- Provide an AP variant of ACs
	- enlarge the effects of ACs so you can see them better
		- maybe slow down their ROF so you can see them better...
	- force ACs & dual turrets not to be able to use strafe
		- ??? they'd have to be class dumbfiremissile?!  but I want them to benefit from other ballistic characteristics
			STUPID, STUPID, STUPID!
	
	
Ideas:
- antimatter only available after getting various other techs (various fusion age weapons, battleships, ? should enable it?)
? Extended focus beams?
	medium mount beams with longer range?
		Prereq for HCL types...
 
New BSOTS
- Increase DN HP ~ 20%?
- give cruiser construction at start, and dn construction
	- but add "battle cruisers" and "battleships" as prereqs for the battle versions of these things...
	- allow all sats?
	- allow noncom cruisers?
		- refinery
		- biome (with biome tech)
		- sats? [could req. combat]
	- allow noncom DNs?
		- constructors (make them all DN sized)
		- sats? [could req. combat]
- restrict DE sats - req. combat DE?
- Huge weapons
	- pulsed lancers (turreted HCLs)

TODO:
	Add tech to tree to research for projector missile mounts
		? separate out planetary missile techs?
	Put CR carriers and DN carriers on industrial tree (DN don't require CR, just construction + combat drones)
		? optional: move DE carriers to industrial as a separate tech from combat drones themselves :)
		
IDEAS:
	Invert speed?
		DE slowest
		CR moderate
		DN fastest
		
		... strat speed especially ...
		Biggest ships = biggest engines
		
	DE = minor armor / reflectives only
	CR = minor of both
	DN = major of both

	Require one advanced combat bridge (AiC, HH or Strafe) for auto bridge unlocks (Assault, etc.)
	Update stations to indicate that they're not DNs (make them section_class destroyers?)
		
Fix Construction Tree
	Projector sections (Artillery) needs its own tech (CR & DN)

Dual Weapons
	* Require DRN_AdvRob and IND_CyberInt (integrated robotics + cybernetic integration)


New Weapon Variants
	* Miniature Medium Emitter (small mount)
	* Miniature Heavy Emitter (medium mount)
	* Improved Heavy Emitter (large mount)
	* Improved Emitter Projector

***
Tech Tree Mount Indicators
	* Use the enable section to enable mount(s)
	* can only be used with weapons which don't enable a section
		^ stop enabling sections with weapons - they should be specified in the construction tree!

***
Make satellites and weapons beyond basics require combat starship engineering

***
Add cpoint increase for all weapons (? can be done ?)
Normalize all health values for DE/CR/DN (mainly reduce Armour/Battle)
