3.0:

Weapons
	Made some small ealry weapons available w/o any of the combat construction techs (so you can get them for scouts, if you wish)
		Autocannon
		Light Emitter
		Small Missiles
		Plasma Cannon

	Autocannon line now doesn't require medium drivers or heavy drivers (you can research them directly)
	Reinforced hulls now requires antimatter (to give standard armors more a day in the sun - rather than immediately having access to reinforced hulls)
	Large Combat tech costs as much as Fusion
	Mega Combat tech costs as much as Antimatter
