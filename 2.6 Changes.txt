TEST:
	Corrosive and Nanite mines
		using "missile" data instead of "mine" - do they work?
		Do they act like mines?
		Do they explode like corrosive & nanite missiles?
	Wraith & Spyship
		Removed range - does that make a difference?
	Shield Bursters
		Based on COL - seems reasonable that they may be workable...

TODO!
			
	Analyze the projector mount weapons (especially wrt new 3x barrel variants) and fix estdam - so that AI players make good choices & good suggestions are made to player)

ICING:
	replace mis_mirv_*.weapon's thrust_effect with mirv-specific missile trails (normal & fast)
	fast corrosive / fast nanite - missile trail effects...
	set missile muzzle_speed to 1/2 their final speed?  does this look better?
		
DELETE: 
	shield bursters ?
		?? add a shield burster beam?

CHANGES:
	Armor:
		Reinforced hulls now requires antimatter (to give standard armors more a day in the sun - rather than immediately having access to reinforced hulls)
	Ships:
		Fixed a number of bugs with turret models and drone models
		Standardized section naming between size classes
	CnC:
		Standard CNC -> Bonus #1 -> Improved CnC -> Bonus #2 -> Advanced CnC -> Flag CnC
	Economy:
		Removed Trade (it's just too tedious with it)
			Except Morrigi, who retain it, but was nerfed by 1/2
		Tech costs 2/3 what it did in BSOTS 2.5 to account for the loss of trade
	Weapons:
		corrosive & nanite missiles fire every 36s instead of every 35s
		other missiles fire every 33s instead of every 32s
		added fast direct fire and dual fast direct fire missile racks (fire every 10s instead of every 15s)
		added fast corrosive & fast nanite missiles (fire every 24s)
		fast missiles fire every 22s instead of every 24s
		fast missiles are 50% faster than standard, and fire 50% more often (3:2)
		fast missiles are now exactly as robust as standard missiles
		fast missiles are 2x as maneuverable
		fast missiles have the same range as standard variants (they just get there sooner)
		removed spinal heavy beams (OP - spinal beams make more sense)
		added heavy beams as huge weapons (single barreled HCL, Lancer, Cutting Beam)
		dual huge missiles are nerfed to fire at the same rate as all other missiles (33s std, 24s fast)
		dual huge missiles range are a bit extended to allow them to find additional targets
	Tech:
		weapon techs now show you what size of turret is native for the given weapon type (small, medium, etc.)
		weaponized corrosives now requires terraforming bacteria (used to be advanced genomics)
		dual huge missile launchers requires any combat construction
		fast missiles requires antimatter
		dual missile launchers require antimatter
		corrosive and nanite missiles require large missiles
		KK missiles require neutronium rounds
		Several techs are available without any combat construction techs (emitters, plasma cannons, cloaking, ...)
		most dual turrets now require fusion tech (missiles require antimatter)
		autocannons do not require other types of ballistic weapons (they're independent)
		stations are zero-cost techs that come with the necessary prerequisites
	
FIXES/IMPROVEMENTS
	New drone models from Warcat
	New hiver 3x barrel huge turret (fixed)
	Fast missiles fire every 24s, instead of every 32s for all sizes
	Huge missile mounts fire every 32s, instead of every 16s (was way OP)
	Huge Fast missiles fire every 24s
	Nerfed ballistic weapons knock-back (with dual and triple turrets was knocking things around more than destroying them!) (rescaled all ballistic knock-back effects)
	Improved turret trackign for higher tier PD (1, 1.5, 2.0 laser & ballistic) or (.75, 1.125, 1.5 for beamer PD)
	
IDEAS
	Tech tree: have core concept techs that unlock whole trees
		Superconductivity: ballistics
		Weaponized Photonics: Lasers & Photonic Torps
		Weaponized Plasma: Plasma cannons & Plasma Torps & Lightning Emitters
		Micro Fission Engines: Missiles
		Gravity Control: tractor beams, gravity mines, repulsars
	
	Spinal Mounts
		Could have S = destroyer, M = cruiser, L = dreadnought
		similarly with 'seige' or other types - strafe?
		
New technologies to match existing weapons:
	3x Ballistic Gun
	3x Plasma Cannons (could do a very large single barrel variation)
	3x Beam weapons
	2x Huge missile launchers
	1x Huge lightning emitter
	1x Huge laser beams / pulse cannons
	
New Weapons + Tech:
	Rapid fire missile launcher (just once, automatically applied for all sizes and standard missile types: rapid fire standard missiles, rapid fire fast missiles, not for corrosive or nanite?)
	Advanced Emitters
	3x barrel standard weapons:
		3x small/medium/large turrets (doesn't work for huge turrets - since many start with 3x barrels)
		3x laser, ballistic, plasma
	Cloaked Missiles (Torps?)
	Armored Missiels (lower yeild, duh)
	Swarmer Missiles (not MW - or make MW much better - faster for one thing)
		But really, we need a swarmer launcher - huge mount?  rapid fire a group as a salvo...
	Micro Cloaking Device
		Cloaked mines
		Cloaked missiles
		Cloaked drones
		Cloaked torps?
	
	2nd / 3rd Tier Ballistic PD
		AP PD?
		Autocannon PD?
		AP Autocannon PD?
