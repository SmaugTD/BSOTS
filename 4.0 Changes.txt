4.0:

Combat Construction
	Specialized Sections are now free with the necessary prerequisites

Disruptors
	Disruptor Whip is now free (Zuul only)
	Added dual disruptor cannons to tech tree
	Removed "Heavy Disruptor" -- since there is already a Heavy Disruptor Cannon
	Rearranged tech tree for these elements
	All disruptor techs are now fission age (except dual cannons = fusion)
	
Dreadnoughts
	Rearranged weapons - mainly restored medium & small mounts, but left all huge mounts alone
	
Drones
	NO LONGER using any of ACM's gunship, gunboat, and drone models - they were too buggy

Emitters
	Advanced Emitters now has a tech box!
	Emitter projectors are now free with fusion + cruisers + large emitters (reused its tech box for advanced emitters - something had to give)

Fusion Torpedos
	Tracking varieties require antimatter
	
Mines
	Added link to nuclear mines from fusion warheads

Point Defense
	No longer requires large/mega combat construction

Sheild Bursters
	Removed from game - they were too buggy

Smart Nanites
	Removed link from elemental nanites (now they're enabled from any nanite weapon tech, including nanite virus)
	
Tech Costs
	Reduced the number of techs that are free
	Scaled the upper techs more evenly across the spectrum - increasing much of the early AM era techs by about 50%
		Rationale: My games have been well paced up until AM, where everything suddenly becomes cheap and there's little tech to research after AM
		My hope is that this will push back AM, and will make acquiring AM techs more of a wish-items in late game, instead of a quick stop in Fusion
		before shooting on to AM shortly thereafter.
	Scaled a few of the earlier techs to require 25% more research time as well (polarized plasma, light emitter, Dumb fire missiles, ... and a nmber of other early strong weapons)
	
Tech Chances
	Reduced the number of techs that are guaranteed - restoring the whims of the fates
