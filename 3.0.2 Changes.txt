3.0.2:

Advanced Emitters
	Now subject to sadorandomizer
	We have no tech box in tech tree, so they're free :(

Autocannons
	Disabled all but light autocannons (stormers are the logical progression, and never come in duals)

Drones
	Now a guaranteed tech for all races
		Morrigi still start with them researched automatically
	Drone Carrier techs are now free with the necessary prequisites
		drones already cost a premium over other weapons due to having to invest in combat drones, advanced drones, etc.
		no need to add a second tech-cost premium for drones
	Drone Minelayers switched to use new mini-mines instead of standard mines (approx 1/3 the damage output)
	Using some of ACM's gunship, gunboat, and drone models as improved visuals over our previous models
		
Mines
	Increased cost of all mine weapons (used to be dirt cheap)
	Added mini-mines for satellites and drones (approx 1/3 the damage output vs. standard mines)

Missiles
	Nanites requires corrosives (mines & missiles)
	Huge missiles requires heavy missiles (automatically acquired)
		Now cost more than they did (they still also give planetary missiles, and still are retargetting)
	Added a single huge missile projector as a default weapon for projector mounts (in case you get Asteroid Monitors or other huge-mount designs before researching any projector based mount weapons)
		Cannot be selected, but has no prequisites and will act as a default automatically

PD
	Improved (tweaked using in-game testing)
		Considerably tightened the firing arcs and clustering of emissions (so more of them are likely to hit if the shot is on target)
	Requires Large or Mega Combat Construction
		PD is really for CR and above, though can be mounted on DE once you have CRs for them to protect

Planetary Invasion
	Ships are now granted for free
	
Pulsed Lasers
	Bolts move faster by 50% (from 1000m/s to 1500m/s)
		(slow for light speed, but improves laser accuracy a bit, and looks better IMO)
		
Miscellaneous
	Fusion tech now requires Orbital Economy (industrial tech)
		This avoids having fusion sometimes given out as a freebie when setting up a new game!
	
Satellites
	Added techs for various satellite blueprints (standard defense, large defense, minlelayer, etc.)
		You will get notification when you gain techs that enable a satellite to be designed
	Satellites requires combat construction for the size-class in question
	Minelayer sats also requires any mine tech
	Sats now use mini-mines instead of standard mines (approx 1/3 the damage output)

Shields
	Now require you to research shield prototype tech first
		you won't know what you have access to until you research this progenitor tech
	Nerfed shields compared to 3.0.1
		Rapid shields cost less
		Heavy shields cost more
	Quantum Capacitors and Shield Magnifiers now each give +50% shield strength (was 25% and 100% respectively)
	
Tractor Beams
	Require huge mount instead of large
		Fixes spamming of them (a world needs DN sized defense platforms to have them - similarly, they can be mounted only as a special cruiser or on battleships)

-----------------
		
NEED: 
	3D: Small missile turret & small missile barrel & 2x barrels

??? Bugs:
	single nanite missile not ever enabling in combat...
